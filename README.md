# Car-price-prediction
Car price prediction estimates a vehicle's value based on features like make, model, year, mileage, engine size, transmission, and fuel type. These attributes influence market value, with newer, low-mileage cars typically priced higher. The prediction model helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships make informed decisions.
